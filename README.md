## Implementation

To set up and run the MediaPipe LLM Inference task for web applications, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your browser supports WebGPU, like Chrome on macOS or Windows.
2. Create a folder named llm_task.
3. Copy index.html and index.js files into your llm_task folder.
4. Download the Gemma 2B model from Gemma or convert an external LLM model (Phi-2, Falcon, or StableLM) into the llm_task folder, ensuring it’s compatible with a GPU backend.
5. In the index.js file, update the modelFileName variable to match your model file’s name.
6. Run a local server within the llm_task folder using the command python -m http.server 8080 or python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 for older Python versions.
7. Open localhost:8080 in your Chrome browser. The web interface will activate, ready for use in about 10 seconds.
